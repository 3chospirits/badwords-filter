Also as for the whole "quality over quantity" thing, any social media, or community, attracts much more quality members if they have the quantity. Sometimes you need quantity to gain quality. We have some quality already though and it's strange to see some of you still think there's something "off". If something is off to you, try to get the original people you hung around active again, or accept the fact that people come and go. You can't expect everyone to always stay. Also, I deleted the messages because they were encouraging others to leave. They would do more harm staying there than if we deleted. I don't care if a few dumbasses come out and say "hey, you deleted that this is bad server", it's  much better than a quality member looking at it and wanting to leave.`);
